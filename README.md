## One Fun Fact to Rule Them All
When I tragically fell in battle (got sick) in an age long past (2018), it was discovered that a hemolytic anemia was causing my spleen to eat me from the inside. You haven't felt true pain until you realize that your true enemy was you the whole time (there was also a lot of other pain going on). I knew what I had to do, but it didn't make it any easier. With a heavy heart I murdered my own spleen, and in its wake I must eternally consume antibiotics to compensate. Thus, I have earned the name Spleenicus, for before it was my enemy, my spleen was indeed my friend.
